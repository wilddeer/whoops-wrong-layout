# ðŸ¤¬ Whoops, wrong layout!

A tiny library that corrects wrong layout while you type in a field that only accepts English letters, e.g. credit card name field.

## Installation

```
npm install whoops-wrong-layout
```

Or just grab the file and do whatever you want with it.

## Usage

```js
const whoopsWrongLayout = require('whoops-wrong-layout');
const input = document.querySelector('.js-card-name');

whoopsWrongLayout(input);
````

## Quirks

- Only corrects the letters as you type them on your **physical** keyboard:
    - wonâ€™t change whatâ€™s already in the field,
    - wonâ€™t mess with pasted text,
    - wonâ€™t change anything typed from a touch screen (you wonâ€™t be typing in the wrong layout from your phone anyway, itâ€™s a physical keyboard mistake).
- Works with any layout, but will only correct the letters that are not in the English alphabet:
    - wonâ€™t mess with [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) or [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak) users (giveâ€™em a break, they are already pretty messed up ðŸ™ƒ),
    - wonâ€™t mess with layouts that contain Engish letters in non-standard positions (like German, for instance).
- Only corrects letters, doesnâ€™t do anything with numbers, punctuation or any other symbols.
- Doesnâ€™t work in Internet Explorer, but also doesnâ€™t break anything.
